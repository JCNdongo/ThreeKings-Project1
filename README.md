The purpose of our study is to explain the difference in salaries among people. We will use a free dataset that we downloaded from Kaggle.com on March 22, 2023. Our regression analysis will determine the impact of years of qualification, sex, highest level of qualification, influencing, sector, and level of computer literacy on wages.
